# Folder Declutter

[![Build and Release](https://github.com/ricardodantas/folder-declutter/actions/workflows/release.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ricardodantas/folder-declutter/actions/workflows/release.yml)

Folder Declutter is a command-line and library utility written in Rust that helps you free up disk space by automatically deleting files that haven't been modified in a specified number of days.

> **Supported Operating Systems:**
>
> Linux and macOS only. *Windows support will be available in version 2.0*

## How It Works

1. **Parameters:** The tool accepts two parametersâ€”the target folder path and the file age threshold (in days).
2. **Cutoff Calculation:** It computes a cutoff time by subtracting the provided number of days from the current system time.
3. **File Deletion:** The tool then recursively scans the folder and deletes files whose last modified time is older than the cutoff.

## Getting Started

### Download and Installation

Execute the commands below:

```bash
brew tap ricardodantas/tap
```

```bash
brew install folder-declutter
```

### Scheduling with Cron

To automate the cleanup, add the following entry to your crontab:

```crontab
0 9 * * * folder-declutter --folder ~/Downloads --older-than-days 7
```

This cron setup will run Folder Declutter daily, removing files in the specified folder that are older than seven days.
